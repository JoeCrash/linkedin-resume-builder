project needs...

linkedin api read access:
- pull in all profile data
- jobs, skills, projects

react/next based UI:
- do I need next? for what?
- how should I introduce theming?
- should i include redux?

pdf generator:
- client side generator

oauth integration:
- why? to send data back?
- to ease logins, skip a registration

persistence:
- airtable or db?
- need to save the customizations made
- need to save the description specifics

concerns for later:
- paragraph based job descriptions vs bullet point lists
- ATS checking resume
- chatgpt integration for suggestions to improve descriptions
